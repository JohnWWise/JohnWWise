## <img src="./tessera-logo.svg" alt="Tessera Tiles logo" width="34" align="top" />  What I'm Currently Building

**[Tessera Tiles](https://github.com/JohnWWise/tessera-tiles)**
An open-source, local-first knowledge vault built on **[Solid Pods](https://solidproject.org/)** and **[Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data)** principles.  
Focused on **personal data sovereignty**, **offline-first** workflows, and **decentralized** architecture — empowering users to *own and structure their data* on their terms.

## 🌍 Mission & Values

I believe in **human-centered AI** and **sovereign data architectures**.  
After nearly two decades of incarceration, I've committed myself to building tools that foster:

- **Transparency** — unlocking access to public data.
- **Justice** — using technology to analyze and highlight inequities in incarceration and poverty.
- **Sovereignty** — empowering individuals to own their digital lives.
- **Ethics** — developing AI that serves people, not profit motives.

My lived experience drives my dedication to making systems and tools that are *liberating* rather than *exploitative*.

## 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring

- Solid ecosystem deeper integrations (resource permissions, decentralized authentication flows)
- Local-first AI models and self-hosted inference engines
- Advanced RDF Data Management and Reasoning
- Rust (for future low-latency, privacy-preserving system development)

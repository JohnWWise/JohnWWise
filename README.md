# 🌾 Hi, I'm John Wise

## 🧭 Welcome

This GitHub account exists for **compatibility and collaboration only**.

I participate here because many academic institutions, research teams, and open-source collaborators still rely on GitHub. I do not, however, endorse Microsoft’s consolidation of open infrastructure or its monetization of community labor through platforms like Copilot.

For long-term projects and ethically hosted code, find me at:

📬 **[Email](mailto:john@johnwise.me)** – thoughtful dialogue welcome  
🐘 **[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@johnwise)** – decentralized presence  

---

I believe that infrastructure reflects intention.  
We need tools that protect autonomy, foster trust, and serve people — not platforms.
